# DeepDay	
Deep work scheduling assistant built with SwiftUI

### Why

This app (incomplete) is designed to challenge conventional menu-based UIs, a pet project of mine. It's UI operates at higher levels of abstraction; making heavy use of swiping, scrolling, drag and drop, etc. to provide it's functionality. As if Fig Jam meets Reminders+Calendar app.

View the `.mov` files in DeepDay/ folder to see UI recordings.
